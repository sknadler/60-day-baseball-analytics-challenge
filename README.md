# 60-Day Baseball Analytics Challenge

From August to October 2025, I have decided to challenge myself with a 60-day challenge to create five baseball analytics projects to translate my machine learning and data science skills to the sports world. Here are the five projects I will be working on:

- Optimizing Batting Lineups: A Monte Carlo Approach
- Project 2
- Project 3
- Project 4
- Project 5
