# 60-Day Baseball Analytics Challenge

From August to October 2025, I have decided to challenge myself with a 60-day challenge to create five baseball analytics projects to translate my machine learning and data science skills to the sports world. Here are the five projects I will be working on:

- Does the Home Run Derby Affect a Batter's Swing?
- Replicating Rapsodo: Classifying Pitches with Kinematic Data
- The Effect of Defensive Alignments and Lineups on Batted Ball Outcomes
- Optimizing Batting Lineups: A Monte Carlo Approach
- Creating a New Baseball Metric (TBD)
